About Plurk
-----------

Plurk is a twitter-like microblogging service that is super popular in many
Asian countries. It differs from Twitter in that it offers more engaging
conversations in the form of threaded responses. It also has several other
interesting features such as karma, emoticons, and qualifiers.

You can find out more about Plurk at http://www.plurk.com/faq.


About Vala
----------

Vala is a fairly new language. The Vala compiler compiles .vala code into .c
code and .h headers. It can also build binaries directly from .vala files. The
Vala compiler is updated very frequently. If you are building the project
yourself, you might want to upgrade your valac to the newest version at the
community-maintained Vala PPA (https://launchpad.net/~vala-team/+archive/ppa).

To find out more about Vala please visit http://live.gnome.org/Vala.
